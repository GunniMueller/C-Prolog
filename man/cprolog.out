               This is a revised edition of the user's  manual  for
               C-Prolog,  a  Prolog interpreter written in C for 32
               bit machines.  C-Prolog is based on an earlier  Pro-
               log  interpreter written in IMP for the EMAS operat-
               ing system by Luis Damas, who borrowed many  aspects
               of the design from the DECsystem-10/20 Prolog system
               developed  by  David   Warren,   Fernando   Pereira,
               Lawrence  Byrd  and  Luis  Pereira.   This manual is
               based on the EMAS Prolog manual, which in  turn  was
               based on the DECsystem-10/20 Prolog manual.

           _1._1.  _P_r_e_f_a_c_e

                This manual describes C-Prolog,  a  Prolog  interpreter
           written  in  C.   C-Prolog was developed at EdCAAD, Dept. of
           Architecture, University of Edinburgh, and  is  based  on  a
           previous  interpreter, written in IMP for the EMAS operating
           system by Luis Damas  of  the  Dept.  of  Computer  Science,
           University of Edinburgh.  C-Prolog was designed for machines
           with a large, uniform, address space, and assumes a  pointer
           cell  32  bits  wide.  At  the  time of writing, it has been
           tested on VAX[2] machines  under  the  UNIX[3]  and  VAX/VMS
           operating  systems, on the Sun workstation under 4.1/2 UNIX,
           and has been ported with minor  changes  to  other  MC68000-
           based workstations and to the Three Rivers PERQ.

                Prolog is a simple but  powerful  programming  language
           originally  developed  at the University of Marseilles, as a
           practical tool for programming  in  logic.   From  a  user's
           point  of  view the major attraction of the language is ease
           of programming.  Clear, readable, concise  programs  can  be
           written quickly with few errors.  Prolog is especially suit-
           able for high-level symbolic programming tasks and has  been
           applied in many areas of Artificial Intelligence research.

                The system consists of a Prolog interpreter and a  wide
           range  of  builtin  (system defined) procedures.  Its design
           was based on the (Edinburgh) DECsystem-10 Prolog system  and
           the  system  is  closely compatible with DECsystem-10 Prolog
           and thus is also reasonably close to PDP-11 UNIX  and  RT-11
           Prolog.

                This manual is not intended as an introduction  to  the
           Prolog  language  and  how  to use it.  For this purpose you
           should study:

                This manual assumes that  you  are  familiar  with  the
           principles  of  the  Prolog  language,  its purpose being to
           explain how to use C-Prolog, and to describe all the  evalu-
           able predicates provided by C-Prolog.

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                     2


           _1._2.  _U_s_i_n_g _C-_P_r_o_l_o_g -- _O_v_e_r_v_i_e_w

                C-Prolog offers the  user  an  interactive  programming
           environment  with tools for incrementally building programs,
           debugging programs by following their executions, and  modi-
           fying  parts  of programs without having to start again from
           scratch.

                The text of a Prolog program is normally created  in  a
           number  of  files using a text editor.  C-Prolog can then be
           instructed to read-in programs from  these  files;  this  is
           called  _l_c_o_n_s_u_l_t_i_n_g  the file.  To change parts of a program
           being run, it is possible to _r_e_c_o_n_s_u_l_t files containing  the
           changed parts.  Reconsulting means that definitions for pro-
           cedures in the file will replace  any  old  definitions  for
           these procedures.

                It is recommended that you make use of a number of dif-
           ferent files when writing programs.  Since you will be edit-
           ing and consulting/reconsulting individual files it is  use-
           ful to use files to group together related procedures; keep-
           ing collections of procedures that do  different  things  in
           different  files.   Thus  a Prolog program will consist of a
           number of files, each file containing a  number  of  related
           procedures.

                When your programs start to grow to a fair size, it  is
           also  a  good idea to have one file which just contains com-
           mands to the interpreter to  consult  all  the  other  files
           which form a program.  You will then be able to consult your
           entire program by just consulting this single file.

           _1._3.  _A_c_c_e_s_s _t_o _C-_P_r_o_l_o_g

                In this manual, we assume that there is  a  command  on
           your computer

               prolog

           that invokes C-Prolog.

                We assume that there are three keys or key combinations
           that achieve the effects of terminating an input line, mark-
           ing end of input, and interrupting execution of  a  program.
           Because  these  depend  on  operating  system and individual
           tastes, they are denoted  in  this  manual  by  END-OF-LINE,
           END-OF-INPUT  and  INTERRUPT respectively (they are carriage
           return, control-Z and control-C  on  the  computer  this  is
           being written on).

                Since Prolog makes  syntactic  use  of  the  difference
           between  upper  and lower case it is important that you have
           your terminal set up so that it accepts lower  case  in  the

           normal way.  This means, for a start, that you must be using
           an upper and lower case terminal - and not, for example,  an
           upper  case  only  teletype.   It  is possible to use Prolog
           using upper case only (see Section 2.4) but it  is  unneces-
           sarily  painful.   We shall assume both upper and lower case
           throughout this manual.

           If you type the  `prolog'  command,  Prolog  will  output  a
           banner and prompt you for directives as follows:

               C-Prolog version 1.5
               | ?-

           There will be a pause between the first line and the  prompt
           while  the system loads itself. It is possible to type ahead
           during this period if you get impatient.

                If you give an argument to  the  `prolog'  command,  C-
           Prolog  will interpret it as the name of a file containing a
           saved state created earlier, and  will  restore  that  saved
           state.  Saved states will be explained fully later.

               prolog prog         (Restore "prog")


                C-Prolog uses six major internal data areas: the  _h_e_a_p,
           the  _g_l_o_b_a_l _s_t_a_c_k, the _l_o_c_a_l _s_t_a_c_k, the _t_r_a_i_l, the _a_t_o_m _a_r_e_a
           and the _a_u_x_i_l_i_a_r_y _s_t_a_c_k. Although the  system  is  initially
           configured  with  reasonable  allocations  for each of those
           areas, a particular program might exceed one of the  alloca-
           tions,  causing an error message. Ideally, the system should
           adjust the available storage among areas automatically,  but
           this facility is not implemented yet.  Instead, the user may
           specify when starting Prolog the allocations  (in  K  bytes)
           for some or all of the areas. This is done by giving command
           line switches between the program name and the optional file
           argument. For example,

               prolog -h 1000 -g 1000 -l 500 bigprogram

           specifies heap and global stack allocations of 1000 K and  a
           local  stack  allocation  of 500 K. The full set of switches
           is:


               -h _N   heap allocation is _N K bytes
               -g _N   global stack allocation is _N K bytes
               -l _N   local stack allocation is _N K bytes
               -t _N   trail allocation is _N K bytes
               -a _N   atom area allocation is _N K bytes
               -x _N   auxiliary stack allocation is _N K bytes

           _1._4.  _R_e_a_d_i_n_g-_i_n _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_s

                A  program  is  made  up  of  a  sequence  of  clauses,
           possibly  interspersed   with   directives   to   the inter-
           preter.  The clauses of  a  procedure  do  not  have  to  be
           immediately  consecutive,  but remember that their  relative
           order  may  be  important.

                To input a program from a file _f_i_l_e,  give  the  direc-
           tive:

               | ?- [_f_i_l_e].

           which will instruct the interpreter to consult the  program.
           The  file  specification _f_i_l_e must be a Prolog atom.  It may
           be any file name, note that if this file name contains char-
           acters  which are not normally allowed in an atom then it is
           necessary to surround the whole file specification with sin-
           gle  quotes  (since quoted atoms can include any character),
           for example

               | ?- ['people/greeks'].

           The specified file is then read in.  Clauses in the file are
           stored  in  the  database  ready  to  be executed, while any
           directives are obeyed as they are encountered.  When the end
           of  the file is found,  the interpreter displays on the ter-
           minal the time spent in  reading-in   and  the   number   of
           bytes occupied  by  the program.

                In  general,  this  directive  can  be  any   list   of
           filenames, such as:

               | ?- [myprogram, extras, testbits].

           In this case all  three  files  would  be  consulted.  If  a
           filename is preceded by a minus sign, as in:

               | ?- [-testbits, -moreideas].

           then that file is reconsulted. The difference  between  con-
           sulting and reconsulting is important, and works as follows:
           if a file is consulted then all the clauses in the file  are
           simply added to C-Prolog's database. If you consult the same
           file twice then you will get two copies of all the  clauses.
           However,  if  a file is reconsulted then the clauses for all
           the procedures in the file will replace any existing clauses
           for  those  procedures, that is any such previously existing
           clauses in the database get thrown  away.   Reconsulting  is
           useful for telling Prolog about corrections in your program.

                Clauses may also be typed in directly at the  terminal.
           To  enter  clauses  at  the  terminal,  you  must  give  the

           directive:

               | ?- [user].

           The interpreter is now in a state where it expects input  of
           clauses  or  directives.   To get back  to  the top level of
           the interpreter, type the END-OF-INPUT character.

                Typing clauses directly into C-Prolog is  only   recom-
           mended  if  the  clauses  will  not  be  needed permanently,
           and are few in number.  For significant bits of program  you
           should  use  an editor to produce a file containing the text
           of the program.

           _1._5.  _D_i_r_e_c_t_i_v_e_s:  _Q_u_e_s_t_i_o_n_s _a_n_d _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

                When Prolog is at top level (signified  by  an  initial
           prompt  of  "| ?- ",  with  continuation lines prompted with
           "|    ", that is indented out from the left margin) it reads
           in terms and treats them as directives to the interpreter to
           try and satisfy some goals.   These  directives  are  called
           questions.  Remember that Prolog terms must terminate with a
           period ("."), and that therefore  Prolog  will  not  execute
           anything  for  you until you have typed the period (and then
           END-OF-LINE) at the end of the directive.

                Suppose list membership has been defined by:

               member(X,[X|_]).
               member(X,[_|L]) :- member(X,L).

           (Note the use of anonymous variables written "_").

                If the goal(s) specified in a question  can  be  satis-
           fied, and if there are no variables as in this example:

               | ?- member(b,[a,b,c]).

           then the system answers

               yes

           and execution of the question terminates.

                If variables are included in  the  question,  then  the
           final  value  of  each  variable  is  displayed  (except for
           anonymous variables).  Thus the question

               | ?- member(X,[a,b,c]).

           would be answered by

               X = a

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                     6


           At this point the interpreter is waiting for you to indicate
           whether  that solution is sufficient, or whether you want it
           to backtrack to see if there are any more solutions.  Simply
           typing END-OF-LINE terminates the question, while typing ";"
           followed by END-OF-LINE causes the system to backtrack look-
           ing  for alternative solutions.  If no further solutions can
           be found it outputs

               no

           The outcome of some questions is  shown   below,   where   a
           number  preceded  by  "_"  is  a system-generated name for a
           variable.

               | ?- member(X,[tom,dick,harry]).
               X = tom ;
               X = dick ;
               X = harry ;
               no
               | ?- member(X,[a,b,f(Y,c)]),member(X,[f(b,Z),d]).
               Y = b,
               X = f(b,c),
               Z = c
                                       % Just END-OF-LINE typed here
               yes
               | ?- member(X,[f(_),g]).
               X = f(_1728)
               yes
               | ?-

           When C-Prolog reads terms from a file (or from the  terminal
           following  a  call to [user]), it treats them all as program
           clauses. In order to get the interpreter to  execute  direc-
           tives  from  a file they must be preceded by `?-', for ques-
           tions, or `:-', for commands.

                Commands are like questions except  that  they  do  not
           cause answers to be printed out.  They always start with the
           symbol ":-". At top level this is simply written  after  the
           prompted  "?-"  which  is  then effectively overridden.  Any
           required output must be programmed explicitly; for  example,
           the command

               :- member(3,[1,2,3]), write(ok).

           directs the system to check whether 3 belongs  to  the  list
           [1,2,3],  and  to output "ok" if so.  Execution of a command
           terminates when all the goals  in  the  command  have   been
           successfully    executed.     Other  alternative   solutions
           are  not  sought (one may imagine an implicit "cut"  at  the
           end  of  the command).  If no solution  can  be  found,  the
           system gives:

                The main use for commands (as opposed to questions)  is
           to allow files to contain directives which call various pro-
           cedures, but for which you don't want to  have  the  answers
           printed  out.   In such cases you only want to call the pro-
           cedures for effect.  A useful example would be the use of  a
           directive  in  a  file  which consults a whole list of other
           files, such as[4]:

               :-([ bits, bobs, mainpart, testcases, data, junk ]).


                If this directive was contained in the  file  `program'
           then  typing the following at top level would be a quick way
           of loading your entire program:

               | ?- [program].


                When you are simply interacting with the top  level  of
           the Prolog interpreter the distinction between questions and
           commands is not very important.  At the top level you should
           normally only type questions. In a file, if you wish to exe-
           cute some goals then you should use a command. That  is,  to
           execute  a  directive in a file it must be preceded by ":-",
           otherwise it will be treated as a clause.

           _1._6.  _S_a_v_i_n_g _A _P_r_o_g_r_a_m

                Once a program has been read, the interpreter will have
           available  all  the information necessary for its execution.
           This information is called a program _s_t_a_t_e.

                The state of a program may  be  saved  on  a  file  for
           future  execution.  To save a program into a file _f_i_l_e, per-
           form the command:

               ?- save(_f_i_l_e).

           Save can be called at top level, from within a  break  level
           (q.v.), or from anywhere within a program.

           ____________________
              [4]The extra parentheses, with the `:-' immediately  next
           to  them, are currently essential due to a problem with pre-
           fix operators (like `:-') and lists. They are  not  required
           for  commands  that  do not contain lists.  This restriction
           will be eventually removed.

                Once a program has been saved into a   file   _f_i_l_e,  C-
           Prolog can be restored to this saved state by invoking it as
           follows:

               prolog _f_i_l_e

           After execution of this command, the interpreter will be  in
           _e_x_a_c_t_l_y  the  same state as existed immediately prior to the
           call  to  save, except for open files, which  are  automati-
           cally  closed  by save.  That is to say execution will start
           at the goal immediately following the call to save, just  as
           if  save  had returned successfully.  If you saved the state
           at top level then you will be back at top level, but if  you
           explicitly  called  save  from  within your program then the
           execution of your program will continue.

                Saved states can only be restored when C-Prolog is ini-
           tially  run  from command level. Version 1.5 provides no way
           of restoring a saved state from inside C-Prolog.

                Note that when a new version of C-Prolog is  installed,
           saved  states  created with the old version may become unus-
           able.  You are thus advised to rely on source files for your
           programs and not on some gigantic saved state.

                Execution of a  program  is  started  by   giving   the
           interpreter  a directive which contains a call to one of the
           program's procedures.

                Only when  execution  of  one  directive  is   complete
           does   the  interpreter  become  ready  for  another  direc-
           tive.  However, one may interrupt the normal execution of  a
           directive by hitting the INTERRUPT key on your terminal.  In
           response to the prompt

               Action (h for help):

           you can type either "a", "t", "d" or "c"  followed  by  END-
           OF-LINE.   The  "a" response will force Prolog to abort back
           to top level, the "t" option will switch on tracing, the "d"
           response   will  switch on debugging and continue the execu-
           tion, and the "c" response will just continue the execution.

                C-Prolog provides a way to  suspend  the  execution  of
           your program and to enter a new incarnation of the top level
           where you can issue directives to solve goals etc.  When the
           evaluable predicate break is called, the message

               [ Break  (level 1) ]

           will be displayed.  This signals the start of  a  _b_r_e_a_k  and
           except  for  the  effect  of aborts (see below), it is as if
           the interpreter was at top level.  If break is called within
           a  break,  then  another recursive break is started (and the
           message will say (level 2) etc).  Breaks can be  arbitrarily
           nested.

                Typing the END-OF-INPUT   character  will   close   the
           break   and  resume   the   execution  which  was suspended,
           starting at the procedure call  where  the  suspension  took
           place.

                To abort the  current  execution, forcing  an   immedi-
           ate  failure of the directive being executed and a return to
           the top level of the interpreter, call the evaluable  predi-
           cate  abort,  either  from  the  program or by executing the
           directive:

               | ?- abort.

           within a break.  In this case no END-OF-INPUT  character  is
           needed to close the break, because _a_l_l break levels are dis-
           carded and the system returns right back to top  level.  The
           "a" response to INTERRUPT (described above) can also be used
           to force an abort.

                To exit from C-Prolog interpreter you should  give  the
           directive:

               | ?- halt.

           This can be issued either at top level, or within  a  break,
           or indeed from within your program.

                If your program is  still  executing  then  you  should
           interrupt  it  and  abort to return to top level so that you
           can call halt.

                Typing the END-OF-INPUT  charater  at  top  level  also
           causes C-Prolog to terminate.

                The data objects of the language are called  _t_e_r_ms.   A

                The constants include _n_u_m_b_e_rs such as

               0   -999   -5.23  0.23E-5


                Constants also include _a_t_o_ms such as

               a   void   =   :=   'Algol-68'   []

           The symbol for an atom can be any  sequence  of  characters,
           written   in single quotes if there is possibility of confu-
           sion with other symbols (such as variables or  numbers).  As
           in  other   programming  languages,  constants  are definite
           elementary objects.

                Variables  are  distinguished  by  an  initial  capital
           letter  or  by the initial character "_", for example

               X   Value   A   A1   _3   _RESULT

           If a variable is only referred to once, it does not need  to
           be   named  and   may  be  written as an _a_n_o_n_y_m_o_u_s variable,
           indicated by the underline character "_".

                A variable should be thought of as  standing  for  some
           definite   but  unidentified   object.   A variable  is  not
           simply  a  writeable storage  location  as   in   most  pro-
           gramming languages;  rather it is a local name for some data
           object, cf.  the  variable  of   pure   LISP   and  constant
           declarations in Pascal.

                The structured data objects of  the  language  are  the
           compound terms.  A compound term comprises a _f_u_n_c_t_o_r (called
           the _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l functor of the term) and a sequence of one  or
           more  terms called _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.  A functor is characterised by
           its _n_a_m_e, which is an atom, and its _a_r_i_t_y or number of argu-
           ments.  For example the compound term whose functor is named
           `point' of arity 3, with arguments X, Y and Z, is written

               point(X,Y,Z)

           An atom is considered to be a functor of arity 0.

                One  may  think  of  a  functor  as  a record type  and
           the  arguments  of  a  compound  term  as the  fields  of  a
           record.   Compound terms are  usefully  pictured  as  trees.
           For example, the term

               s(np(john),vp(v(likes),np(mary)))

           would be pictured as the structure

                Sometimes it is convenient to write certain functors as
           _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r_s  -- 2-ary functors may be declared as _i_n_f_i_x opera-
           tors and 1-ary functors  as  _p_r_e_f_i_x  or  _p_o_s_t_f_i_x  operators.
           Thus it is possible to write

               X+Y     (P;Q)     X<Y      +X     P;

           as optional alternatives to

               +(X,Y)   ;(P,Q)   <(X,Y)   +(X)   ;(P)

           Operators are described fully in the next section.

                _L_i_s_ts form an important class  of  data  structures  in
           Prolog.   They   are  essentially  the  same  as  the  lists
           of LISP: a list either is the atom

               []

           representing the empty list, or is  a  compound  term   with
           functor   `.'  and  two  arguments  which  are  respectively
           the head and tail of the  list.   Thus   a   list   of   the
           first  three  natural  numbers  is  the structure

                 .
                / \
               1    .
                   / \
                  2    .
                      / \
                     3   []

           which could be written, using the standard syntax, as

               .(1,.(2,.(3,[])))

           but which is normally written, in a special  list  notation,
           as

               [1,2,3]

           The special list notation in the case when the  tail  of   a
           list  is  a variable is exemplified by











.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    12


               [X|L]     [a,b|L]

           representing

                  .                .
                 / \             / \
               X     L          a    .
                                    / \
                                  b     L

           respectively.

                Note that this list syntax is only syntactic sugar  for
           terms  of  the  form `.'(_,_) and does not provide any addi-
           tional facilities that were not available in Prolog.

                For convenience, a  further   notational   variant   is
           allowed   for lists  of  integers  which correspond to ASCII
           character codes.  Lists written in this notation are  called
           _s_t_r_i_n_gs.  For example,

               "Prolog"

           represents exactly the same list as

               [80,114,111,108,111,103]


           _2._2.  _O_p_e_r_a_t_o_r_s

                Operators in Prolog are simply  a  notational  conveni-
           ence.  For example, the expression

               2 + 1

           could also be written +(2,1).  It  should  be  noticed  that
           this expression represents the structure

                  +
                /   \
               2     1

           and not the number 3.  The addition would only be  performed
           if the structure was passed as an argument to an appropriate
           procedure (such as is - see Section 5.2).

                The Prolog syntax caters for operators  of  three  main
           kinds   -  infix,  prefix  and  postfix.   An infix operator
           appears between its two arguments, while a  prefix  operator
           precedes its single argument and a postfix operator is writ-
           ten after its single argument.

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    13


                Each operator has a _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e, which is a number  from
           1   to   1200.   The  precedence  is  used  to  disambiguate
           expressions  where  the  structure  of  the   term   denoted
           is  not  made explicit through the  use  of  brackets.   The
           general  rule is that the operator  with  the  _h_i_g_h_e_s_t  pre-
           cedence  is  the  principal  functor.   Thus  if `+'  has  a
           higher precedence than `/', then

               a+b/c     a+(b/c)

           are equivalent and denote the term "+(a,/(b,c))".  Note that
           the   infix  form  of the term "/(+(a,b),c)" must be written
           with explicit brackets

               (a+b)/c


                If there are two operators in the subexpression  having
           the   same  highest   precedence,   the  ambiguity  must  be
           resolved from the _t_y_p_e_s  of  the  operators.   The  possible
           types for an infix operator are

               xfx     xfy     yfx

           With an operator of type `xfx', it  is  a  requirement  that
           both  of  the two  subexpressions which are the arguments of
           the operator must be of LOWER precedence  than  the   opera-
           tor  itself,  i.e.   their  principal functors  must  be  of
           lower  precedence, unless the  subexpression  is  explicitly
           bracketed   (which   gives  it  zero  precedence).  With  an
           operator of type `xfy', only the first or  left-hand  subex-
           pression  must be of lower precedence;  the second can be of
           the _s_a_m_e  precedence  as the main operator;  and vice  versa
           for an operator of type `yfx'.

                For example, if the operators `+' and  `-'  both   have
           type  `yfx' and are of the same precedence, then the expres-
           sion

               a-b+c

           is valid, and means

               (a-b)+c     i.e.  +(-(a,b),c)

           Note that the expression would be invalid if the   operators
           had  type `xfx', and would mean

               a-(b+c)     i.e.  -(a,+(b,c))

           if the types were both `xfy'.

                The possible types for a prefix operator are

               fx        fy

           and for a postfix operator they are

               xf        yf

           The meaning of the types should be clear by   analogy   with
           those  for infix  operators.   As  an example, if `not' were
           declared as a prefix operator of type `fy', then

               not not P

           would be a permissible way to write "not(not(P))".  If   the
           type   were  `fx',  the  preceding  expression  would not be
           legal, although

               not P

           would still be a permissible form for "not(P)".

                In C-Prolog, a functor named _n_a_m_e is  declared  as   an
           operator  of  type _t_y_p_e and precedence _p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e by calling
           the evaluable predicate op:

               | ?- op(_p_r_e_c_e_d_e_n_c_e,_t_y_p_e,_n_a_m_e).

           The argument _n_a_m_e can also be a list of names  of  operators
           of the same type and precedence.

                It is possible to have more than one  operator  of  the
           same   name,  so  long  as they are of different kinds, i.e.
           infix, prefix or postfix.  An operator of any  kind  may  be
           redefined  by  a new declaration  of  the same  kind.   This
           applies equally to operators which are provided as  _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d
           in C-Prolog, namely:


               :- op(   1200,   xfx,   [ :-, --> ]).
               :- op(   1200,    fx,   [ :-, ?- ]).
               :- op(   1100,   xfy,   [ ; ]).
               :- op(   1050,   xfy,   [ -> ]).
               :- op(   1000,   xfy,   [ ',' ]).   /* See note below */
               :- op(    900,    fy,   [ not, \+, spy, nospy ]).
               :- op(    700,   xfx,   [ =, is, =.., ==, \==, @<, @>, @=<, @>=,
                                         =:=, =\=, <, >, =<, >= ]).
               :- op(    500,   yfx,   [ +, -, /\, \/ ]).
               :- op(    500,    fx,   [ +, - ]).
               :- op(    400,   yfx,   [ *, /, //, <<, >> ]).
               :- op(    300,   xfx,   [ mod ]).
               :- op(    200,   xfy,   [ ^ ]).

                Operator declarations are most usefuly placed in direc-
           tives  at  the  top  of your program files. In this case the
           directive should be a command as shown above. Another common
           method  of  organisation is to have one file just containing
           commands to declare all the necessary operators.  This  file
           is then always consulted first.

                Note that a comma written literally as  a   punctuation
           character can be used as though it were an infix operator of
           precedence 1000 and type `xfy':

               X,Y    ','(X,Y)

           represent the same compound term.  But  note  that  a  comma
           written as  a quoted atom is _n_o_t a standard operator.

                Note also that the  arguments  of   a   compound   term
           written   in  standard   syntax  must be expressions of pre-
           cedence _b_e_l_o_w 1000. Thus it  is  necessary  to  bracket  the
           expression "P:-Q" in

               assert((P:-Q))

           The following syntax restrictions serve  to remove potential
           ambiguity associated with prefix operators.

           -    In a term written in standard  syntax,  the   principal
                functor    and   its   following   "("   must   _n_o_t  be
                separated by any blankspace.  Thus

                    point (X,Y,Z)

                is invalid syntax.

           -    If the argument of a prefix operator starts with a "(",
                this  "(" must  be  separated  from  the operator by at
                least one space or other non-printable character.  Thus

                    :-(p;q),r.

                (where `:-' is the prefix operator) is invalid  syntax,
                and must be written as

                    :- (p;q),r.


           -    If a prefix  operator  is  written  without  an   argu-
                ment,   as   an ordinary  atom,  the  atom  is  treated
                as  an expression of the same precedence as the  prefix
                operator,  and   must   therefore   be  bracketed where
                necessary.  Thus the brackets are necessary in

                    X = (?-)

                Syntax  errors  are  detected   when  reading.     Each
           clause,  directive  or  in  general  any term read-in by the
           evaluable predicate read that fails to  comply  with  syntax
           requirements  is displayed on the terminal  as  soon  as  it
           is read.  A mark indicates the point in the string  of  sym-
           bols  where the parser has failed to continue  its analysis.
           For example, typing

               member(X,X L).

           gives:

               ***syntax error***
               member(X,X
               ***here***
                L).


                Syntax errors do not disrupt the  (re)consulting  of  a
           file  in  any way except that the clause or command with the
           syntax error will be ignored[5] All the other clauses in the
           file  will  have been read-in properly.  If the syntax error
           occurs at top level then you should just  retype  the  ques-
           tion.  Given that Prolog has a very simple syntax it is usu-
           ally quite straightforward to see what the problems is (look
           for  missing  brackets in particular).  The book _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g
           _i_n _P_r_o_l_o_g gives further examples.

           _2._4.  _U_s_i_n_g _a _T_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _w_i_t_h_o_u_t _L_o_w_e_r-_C_a_s_e

                The syntax of Prolog assumes that a full ASCII  charac-
           ter set  is available.  With this _f_u_l_l _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _s_e_t or `LC'
           convention, variables are  (normally)  distinguished  by  an
           initial  capital  letter, while  atoms  and  other  functors
           must start with a lower-case letter (unless enclosed in sin-
           gle quotes).

                When lower-case is not available, the _n_o _l_o_w_e_r-_c_a_s_e  or
           `NOLC'  convention has to be adopted.  With this convention,
           variables must be  distinguished  by  an  initial  underline
           character  "_", and the names  of atoms  and other functors,
           which now have to be written in upper-case,  are  implicitly
           translated  into  lower-case  (unless  enclosed   in  single
           quotes). For example,

               _VALUE2

           ____________________
              [5]After all, it could not be read.

           is a variable, while

               VALUE2

           is `NOLC' convention notation for the atom which is  identi-
           cal to:

               value2

           written in the `LC' convention.

                The default convention is `LC'. To  switch  to  the  no
           lower-case convention, call the evaluable predicate `NOLC':

               | ?- 'NOLC'.

           To switch back to  the  full   character   set   convention,
           call  the evaluable predicate `LC':

               | ?- 'LC'.


                Note that the names of these two procedures consist  of
           upper-case  letters   (so  that  they  can  be  referred  to
           on  all devices), and therefore the  names  must  _a_l_w_a_y_s  be
           enclosed in single quotes.

                It is recommended that the `NOLC'  convention  only  be
           used in emergencies, since the standard syntax is far easier
           to use and is also easier for other people to read.

                A fundamental unit of a logic program is  the  _l_i_t_e_r_a_l,
           for instance

               gives(tom,apple,teacher)   reverse([1,2,3],L)   X<Y

           A literal is merely a term distinguished by the  context  in
           which it appears in the program.  The (principal) functor of
           a literal is called a _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e.    It  corresponds  roughly
           to   a verb in natural language, or to a procedure name in a
           conventional programming language.

                A logic _p_r_o_g_r_a_m consists simply of a sequence of state-
           ments  called _c_l_a_u_s_e_s, which  are  analogous to sentences of
           natural language.  A clause comprises a  _h_e_a_d  and  a  _b_o_d_y.
           The  head  either  consists of a single literal or is empty.
           The body  consists of a sequence of  zero  or  more  literal
           (that is, it too may be empty). The body literals are called
           _g_o_a_l_s or _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e _c_a_l_l_s.

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    18


                A clause with empty head is a _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e _c_l_a_u_s_e or _q_u_e_r_y,
           and represents a command to the interpreter to start proving
           the goals in its body. The form of a query is

               :- _P,_Q,_R.

           but, as described in Section 1.5, the ":-"  can  be  omitted
           when typing a command to the interpreter.

                From here on, when we use the term "clause" we  mean  a
           _p_o_s_i_t_i_v_e clause, that is one with nonempty head.

                If the body of a clause is empty, the clause is  called
           a _u_n_i_t clause, and  is written in the form

               _P.

           where _P is the head literal.   We  interpret  this  declara-
           tively as

               "_P is true."

           and procedurally as

               "_P can be satisfied."

           If  the  body of a clause is nonempty, the clause is  called
           a _n_o_n_u_n_i_t _c_l_a_u_s_e, and is written in the form

               _P :- _Q, _R, _S.

           where _P is the head and _Q, _R and _S are the goals which  make
           up   the   body.   We can read such a clause either declara-
           tively as

               "_P is true if _Q and _R and _S are true."

           or procedurally as

               "To satisfy goal _P, satisfy goals _Q, _R and _S."


                Clauses in  general  contain  variables.    Note   that
           variables  in  different clauses are completely independent,
           even if they have the same name  -- the  _l_e_x_i_c_a_l  _s_c_o_p_e   of
           a   variable  is  limited to a single clause.  Each distinct
           variable in a clause  should  be  interpreted   as  standing
           for   an  arbitrary   entity,   or   value.    To illustrate
           this, here are some examples of clauses   containing   vari-
           ables,   with   possible  declarative  and  procedural read-
           ings:












.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    19


                employed(X) :- employs(Y,X).

                    "Any X is employed if any Y employs X."

                    "To find whether a person X is employed,
                    find whether any Y employs X."


                derivative(X,X,1).

                    "For any X, the derivative of X with respect to X is 1."

                    "The goal of finding a derivative for the expression X with
                    respect to X itself is satisfied by the result 1."


                :- ungulate(X), aquatic(X).

                    "Is it true, for any X, that X is an ungulate and X is
                    aquatic?"

                    "Find an X which is both an ungulate and aquatic."


                In  a  program, the _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e for a  particular  predi-
           cate  is  the sequence of clauses in the program whose  head
           goals  have  that   predicate  as  principal  functor.   For
           example,  the  procedure  for  a 3-ary predicate concatenate
           might consist of the two clauses

               concatenate([X|L1],L2,[X|L3]) :-
                   concatenate(L1,L2,L3).
               concatenate([],L,L).

           where concatenate(L1,L2,L3) means "the list L1  concatenated
           with the list L2 is the list L3".

                In Prolog, several predicates may have the  same   name
           but  different arities.  Therefore,  when it is important to
           specify a predicate unambiguously, the  form  <name>/<arity>
           is used, for example concatenate/3.

                Certain predicates are predefined  by  procedures  sup-
           plied  by  the  Prolog  system.  Such  predicates are called
           _e_v_a_l_u_a_b_l_e _p_r_e_d_i_c_a_t_e_s.

                As we have seen, the goals in the body of a clause  are
           linked  by the operator `,'  which  can  be  interpreted  as
           conjunction ("and").    It  is sometimes convenient  to  use
           an additional operator `;', standing for disjunction  ("or")
           (The precedence of `;' is such that it dominates `,' but  is
           dominated by `:-'.). An example is the clause.

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    20


               grandfather(X,Z) :- (mother(X,Y); father(X,Y)), father(Y,Z).

            which can be read as

               "For any X, Y and Z, X has Z as a grandfather if either the mother
               of X is Y or the father of X is Y, and the father of Y is Z."

           Such  uses  of  disjunction  can  always  be  eliminated  by
           defining  an  extra  predicate  -  for instance the previous
           example is equivalent to

               grandfather(X,Z) :- parent(X,Y), father(Y,Z).
               parent(X,Y) :- mother(X,Y).
               parent(X,Y) :- father(X,Y).

           and so disjunction will not be  mentioned  further  in   the
           following,   more  formal,  description  of the semantics of
           clauses.

           _3._2.  _D_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_v_e _a_n_d _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_a_l _S_e_m_a_n_t_i_c_s

                The  semantics  of  definite  clauses  should be fairly
           clear  from  the  informal  interpretations  already  given.
           However  it  is  useful  to  have   a   precise  definition.
           The  _d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_v_e_s_e_m_a_n_t_i_c_s of definite clauses tells us which
           goals can be considered true according to a  given  program,
           and is defined recursively as follows.

               A  goal  is  _t_r_u_e if it is the head of  some  clause
               instance  and each of the goals (if any) in the body
               of that clause _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e is  true,  where an instance
               of  a  clause (or term) is obtained by substituting,
               for each of zero or more of  its  variables,  a  new
               term for all occurrences of the variable.

           For  example,  if  a  program contains  the  preceding  pro-
           cedure for concatenate, then the declarative semantics tells
           us that

               concatenate([a],[b],[a,b])

           is true, because this  goal  is  the  head  of   a   certain
           instance  of  the  first clause for concatenate, namely,

               concatenate([a],[b],[a,b]) :- concatenate([],[b],[b]).

           and  we  know  that  the only  goal  in  the  body  of  this
           clause instance is true, since it is an instance of the unit
           clause  which  is  the  second  clause  for concatenate.

                The  declarative  semantics makes no reference  to  the
           sequencing  of goals within the body of a clause, nor to the
           sequencing  of   clauses    within    a   program.      This

           sequencing   information   is,   however,  very relevant for
           the _p_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_a_l _s_e_m_a_n_t_i_c_s  which  Prolog  gives  to  definite
           clauses.    The  procedural semantics  defines  exactly  how
           the Prolog system will execute a goal,  and  the  sequencing
           information  is  the  means  by  which the Prolog programmer
           directs  the system  to  execute  his  program in a sensible
           way.  The effect of executing a goal is to enumerate, one by
           one, its true instances.  Here then is an  informal  defini-
           tion of the procedural semantics.

               To execute a goal, the system searches forwards from
               the   beginning  of the program for the first clause
               whose head _m_a_t_c_h_e_s or _u_n_i_f_i_e_s with the goal.     The
               unification  process  finds  the most general common
               instance of the two terms, which is unique if it ex-
               ists.    If   a  match   is   found,   the  matching
               clause  instance is then activated by  executing  in
               turn,  from  left  to  right, each of the goals  (if
               any)  in its  body.  If at any time the system fails
               to  find  a match for a goal, it _b_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_k_s, that is
               it rejects the  most  recently   activated   clause,
               undoing   any   substitutions   made  by  the  match
               with the head of the clause.   Next  it  reconsiders
               the   original  goal  which  activated  the rejected
               clause,  and  tries  to  find  a  subsequent  clause
               which also matches the goal.

           For example, if we execute the goal in the query

               :- concatenate(X,Y,[a,b]).

           we  find  that  it matches the head of the first clause  for
           concatenate, with X instantiated to [a|X1]. The new variable
           X1 is  constrained  by  the  new  goal  produced,  which  is
           the recursive procedure call

               concatenate(X1,Y,[b])

           Again  this  goal  matches  the  first  clause,  instantiat-
           ing X1 to [b|X2], and yielding the new goal

               concatenate(X2,Y,[])

           Now this goal will only match the second clause, instantiat-
           ing both X2 and Y to []. Since there are no further goals to
           be executed, we have a solution

               X = [a,b]
               Y = []

           representing  a true instance of the original goal

               concatenate([a,b],[],[a,b])

           If this solution is rejected, backtracking will generate the
           further solutions

               X = [a]
               Y = [b]

               X = []
               Y = [a,b]

           in that order, by rematching, against the second clause  for
           concatenate,  goals  already  solved  once  using  the first
           clause.

           _3._3.  _O_c_c_u_r_s _C_h_e_c_k

                Prolog's unification does not have an   _o_c_c_u_r_s   _c_h_e_c_k,
           i.e.  when  unifying  a variable  against  a term the system
           does not check whether the  variable  occurs  in  the  term.
           When  the  variable occurs in the term,  unification  should
           fail, but  the  absence of the check means that the unifica-
           tion succeeds, producing a _c_i_r_c_u_l_a_r _t_e_r_m.  Trying to print a
           circular  term,  or  trying  to  unify  two circular  terms,
           will cause an infinite loop and possibly make Prolog run out
           of stack space.

                The absence of the occur check  is   not   a   bug   or
           design   oversight,   but   a  conscious   design  decision.
           The reason for this decision is that  unification  with  the
           occur  check  is at best linear on the sum of the  sizes  of
           the  terms being  unified,   whereas   unification   without
           the occur check is linear on the size of the smallest of the
           terms  being  unified.   In   any   practical    programming
           language,   basic  operations  are supposed to take constant
           time.  Unification  against a variable should be thought  of
           as the basic operation of Prolog, but this can take constant
           time only if the occur check is omitted.   Thus the  absence
           of  a occur check is essential to make Prolog into a practi-
           cal programming language.  The inconvenience caused by  this
           restriction  seems  in practice to be very slight.  Usually,
           the restriction is only felt in toy programs.

           _3._4.  _T_h_e _C_u_t _S_y_m_b_o_l

                Besides the sequencing of  goals  and  clauses,  Prolog
           provides  one  other  very important facility for specifying
           control information.  This is the _c_u_t symbol, written   "!".
           It  is  inserted in the program just like a goal, but is not
           to be regarded as part of  the  logic  of  the  program  and
           should  be ignored  as  far  as the declarative semantics is
           concerned.

                The  effect of the cut  symbol  is  as  follows.   When
           first  encountered  as a goal, cut succeeds immediately.  If

           backtracking should later return to the cut,  the effect  is
           to  fail the _p_a_r_e_n_t _g_o_a_l, the goal which matched the head of
           the clause containing the cut, and caused the clause  to  be
           activated.   In  other  words, the cut operation commits the
           system  to  all  choices  made  since  the parent  goal  was
           invoked, and causes other alternatives to be discarded.  The
           goals thus rendered  _d_e_t_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e   are   the   parent   goal
           itself,   any   goals  occurring   before   the  cut  in the
           clause containing the cut, and any subgoals which were  exe-
           cuted during the execution of those preceding goals.

                For example, the procedure

               member(X,[X|L]).
               member(X,[Y|L]) :- member(X,L).

           can be used to test whether a given term is in a  list,  and
           the goal

               :- member(b,[a,b,c]).

           will succeed.  The procedure can also be  used  to   extract
           elements from a list, as in

               :- member(X,[d,e,f]).

           With  backtracking this will successively return  each  ele-
           ment  of  the  list.   Now suppose that the first clause had
           been written instead:

               member(X,[X|L]) :- !.

           In this case, the above call would extract  only  the  first
           element of  the  list (`d').  On backtracking, the cut would
           immediately fail the whole procedure.

                A procedure of the form

               _x :- _p, !, _q.
               _x :- _r.

           is similar to

               _x := if _p then _q else _r;

           in an Algol-like language.

                A cut discards all the alternatives  since  the  parent
           goal,  even  when  the  cut  appears  within  a disjunction.
           This  means  that  the normal  method  for   eliminating   a
           disjunction by defining an extra predicate cannot be applied
           to a disjunction containing a cut.

                This section   describes   the   debugging   facilities
           that are available in C-Prolog.  The purpose of these facil-
           ities is to provide  information  concerning   the   control
           flow  of  your  program.    The  main features of the debug-
           ging package are as follows:

           -    The _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e _b_o_x model of Prolog execution which  pro-
                vides   a   simple  way  of  visualising control  flow,
                especially during backtracking.  Control flow is viewed
                at the procedure level,  rather  than  at  the level of
                individual clauses.

           -    The  ability to exhaustively trace your program  or  to
                selectively  set  _s_p_y  _p_o_i_n_t_s.  Spy points allow you to
                nominate interesting  procedures at which  the  program
                is to pause so that you can interact.

           -    The  wide  choice of control  and  information  options
                available during debugging.

                Much of the information in this chapter is similar  but
           not identical to that of Chapter 8 of _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _i_n _P_r_o_l_o_g.

           _4._1.  _T_h_e _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e _B_o_x _C_o_n_t_r_o_l _F_l_o_w _M_o_d_e_l

                During  debugging   the   interpreter   prints   out  a
           sequence  of  goals  in  various  states of instantiation in
           order to show the state the  program  has  reached   in  its
           execution.     However,   in  order  to  understand  what is
           occurring it is necessary to understand  when  and  why  the
           interpreter  prints  out  goals.   As  in other  programming
           languages,  key  points of interest are procedure entry  and
           return,  but in Prolog there is the additional complexity of
           backtracking.   One of  the  major  confusions  that  novice
           Prolog  programmers  have  to  face  is the question of what
           actually happens when a goal fails  and  the   system   sud-
           denly  starts backtracking.  The Procedure Box model of Pro-
           log execution views program control  flow in terms of  move-
           ment  about  the  program text.  This model provides a basis
           for the debugging mechanism in the interpreter, and  enables
           the  user  to  view  the  behaviour of his program in a con-
           sistent way.

                Let us look at an example Prolog procedure:

                            *--------------------------------------*
                    Call    |                                      |    Exit
                 ---------> +  descendant(X,Y) :- offspring(X,Y).  + --------->
                            |                                      |
                            |  descendant(X,Z) :-                  |
                 <--------- +     offspring(X,Y), descendant(Y,Z). + <---------
                    Fail    |                                      |    BackTo
                            *--------------------------------------*

           The  first clause states that Y is a descendant of X if Y is
           an  offspring of X, and the second clause states that Z is a
           descendant of X if Y is  an offspring of  X and if  Z  is  a
           descendant  of Y. In the diagram a box has been drawn around
           the whole procedure and labelled arrows indicate the control
           flow  in  and  out  of this box.  There are four such arrows
           which we shall look at in turn.

           Call

                This arrow represents initial invocation  of  the  pro-
                cedure.    When   a  descendant  goal   of   the   form
                descendant(X,Y)  is  required to be satisfied,  control
                passes through the Call _p_o_r_t of the descendant box with
                the intention of matching a component clause  and  then
                satisfying   any  subgoals   in   the  body   of   that
                clause.    Notice that  this is independent of  whether
                such  a  match  is  possible,  that is first the box is
                called, and then the  attempt  to  match  takes  place.
                Textually we can imagine moving to the code for descen-
                dant when meeting  a  call to descendant in some  other
                part of the code.

           Exit

                This arrow represents a successful return from the pro-
                cedure.   This  occurs   when   the  initial  goal  has
                been unified with one of the component clauses and  any
                subgoals  have  been  satisfied.    Control now  passes
                out of the Exit port of the descendant box.   Textually
                we  stop  following the code for descendant and go back
                to the  place we came from.

           BackTo

                This arrow indicates that a subsequent goal has  failed
                and  that  the system has come back to this goal in  an
                attempt  to match  the  goal  against  another  clause.
                Control  passes  through the BackTo  port  of  the des-
                cendant box in an attempt to rematch the original  goal
                with an alternative  clause and  then  try  to  satisfy
                any subgoals  in  the body of this new clause.   Textu-
                ally  we  follow  the  code backwards  up  the  way  we
                came  looking  for new  ways  of succeeding,   possibly

                dropping   down   on  to  another  clause and following
                that if necessary. Note  that  this  is  somewhat  less
                informative than the Redo port described in _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g
                _i_n _P_r_o_l_o_g, because it does not show  the  path  in  the
                program from a failed goal back to the first goal where
                alternative clauses exist, but only this goal.

           Fail

                This arrow represents a failure of the  initial   goal,
                which   might  occur   if  no  clause is matched, or if
                subgoals are never satisfied, or if any  solution  pro-
                duced  is always rejected by later processing.  Control
                now passes out of the Fail port of the descendant   box
                and  the  system  continues to backtrack.  Textually we
                move back to the code which called this  procedure  and
                keep  moving  backwards up  the code looking for choice
                points.

                In  terms of this model, the information we  get  about
           the  procedure  box  is  only the control flow through these
           four ports.  This means that at  this  level   we  are   not
           concerned  with   which   clause   matches,   and   how  any
           subgoals are satisfied, but rather we only wish to know  the
           initial  goal and  the final outcome.  However,  it  can  be
           seen  that whenever we are trying to satisfy subgoals,  what
           we  are  actually  doing  is  passing  through the  ports of
           _t_h_e_i_r respective  boxes.    If  we  were   to  follow  this,
           then  we  would  have complete information about the control
           flow inside the procedure box.

           Note that the box we have drawn round the  procedure  should
           really be seen as an _i_n_v_o_c_a_t_i_o_n _b_o_x.  That is, there will be
           a  different  box  for  each different invocation   of   the
           procedure.     Obviously,   with  something like a recursive
           procedure,  there  will  be many different Calls  and  Exits
           in the control flow, but these will be for different invoca-
           tions.  Since this  might get  confusing each invocation box
           is given a unique integer identifier.

                The   interpreter   provides   a   range  of  evaluable
           predicates  for  control  of  the debugging facilities.  The
           most basic predicates are as follows:

           debug

                Switches _d_e_b_u_g _m_o_d_e on.  (It  is  initially  off.)   In
                order   for  the full  range  of  control  flow  infor-
                mation  to  be available it is necessary to  have  this
                on  from  the  start.     When  it  is  off  the system
                does   not  remember   invocations   that   are   being

                executed.   (This is because it  is expensive  and  not
                required  for  normal running  of  programs.)  You  can
                switch debug mode on in the middle of execution, either
                from within your program or after  an  interrupt   (see
                trace  below),   but  information  prior to  this  will
                just  be unavailable.

           nodebug

                switches debug mode off.  If there are any  spy  points
                set then they will be removed.

           debugging

                prints  onto  the  terminal  information   about    the
                current  debugging state.   It shows whether debug mode
                is on or off and gives various other information to  be
                described later.

           _4._3.  _T_r_a_c_i_n_g

                The following evaluable predicate may be used  to  com-
           mence an  exhaustive trace of a program.

           trace

                Switches  debug  mode on, if it is not on already,  and
                ensures  that  the next time control enters a procedure
                box,  a  message  will  be produced  and  you  will  be
                asked to interact.

                When stopped at a goal being traced, you have a  number
           of options which will be detailed later.  In particular, you
           can just type   END-OF-LINE   (carriage-return)   to   creep
           (or  single-step)   into   your  program. If you continue to
           creep through your program you will see every entry and exit
           to/from  every  invocation  box.  However,  you will  notice
           that  you  are only given the  opportunity  to  interact  on
           Call  and  BackTo  ports,  i.e.  a single creep decision may
           take  you through  several  Exit ports   or   several   Fail
           ports.     Normally  this is desirable, as it would be tedi-
           ous to go through all those ports step by step.  However, if
           it  is  not what you want, the following evaluable predicate
           gives full  control  over   the   ports  at  which  you  are
           prompted.

           leash(_M_o_d_e)

                Sets the _l_e_a_s_h_i_n_g _m_o_d_e to _M_o_d_e, where _M_o_d_e can  be  one
                of the following


                    full    prompt on Call, Exit, BackTo and Fail
                    tight   prompt on Call, BackTo and Fail
                    half    prompt on Call and BackTo
                    loose   prompt on Call
                    off     never prompt

                or any other combination of ports as  described  later.
                The  initial  _l_e_a_s_h_i_n_g _m_o_d_e is `half'.

           _4._4.  _S_p_y _P_o_i_n_t_s

                For programs of any size, it is clearly impractical  to
           creep through the entire program.  Spy points make it possi-
           ble to stop the program whenever it  gets  to  a  particular
           procedure  which  is of interest.  Once there,  one  can set
           further spy points  in  order  to  catch  the control flow a
           bit further on, or one can start creeping.

                Setting a spy-point on a procedure indicates  that  you
           wish  to  see  all control flow  through  the  various ports
           of its invocation boxes.  When control  passes  through  any
           port of a procedure with a spy-point set on it, a message is
           output and the user is asked to  interact.   Note  that  the
           current  mode  of  leashing does not affect spy points: user
           interaction is requested on _e_v_e_r_y port.

                Spy points are set and removed by the following  evalu-
           able predicates which are also standard operators:

           spy _X

                Sets  spy points  on  all the procedures given by _X.  _X
                is  either  a single predicate specification, or a list
                of  such  specifications.  A  predicate   specification
                is   either of the form <atom>/<arity>, which means the
                procedure with the name  <atom>   and   an   arity   of
                <arity>   (for  example   member/2,  foo/0,  hello/27),
                or it is of the form <atom>, which means all  the  pro-
                cedures  with  the   name  <atom>  that currently  have
                clauses in the data-base  (e.g.  member,  foo,  hello).
                This  latter  form  may  refer  to  multiple procedures
                which  have  the same  name   but   different  arities.
                If you use the form <atom> but there are no clauses for
                this predicate (of any  arity)  then  nothing  will  be
                done.   If  you  really  want  to  place  a  spy  point
                on  a currently  non-existent  procedure, then you must
                use  the full form <atom>/<arity>; you will get a warn-
                ing message in this  case.    If you   set   some   spy
                points   when   debug  mode  is  off  then  it  will be
                automatically switched on.

           nospy _X

                This reverses the effect of spy _X: all  the  procedures
                given by  _X will have previously set spy points removed
                from them.

                The  options  available when you arrive at a  spy-point
           are described below.










.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    29


           _4._5.  _F_o_r_m_a_t _o_f _D_e_b_u_g_g_i_n_g _M_e_s_s_a_g_e_s

                We will now look at the exact  format  of  the  message
           output by the system at a port.  All trace messages are out-
           put to the terminal regardless  of  where the current   out-
           put  is  directed.  (This allows you to trace programs while
           they are performing file I/O.)  The basic format is as  fol-
           lows:

               ** (23) 6 Call : foo(hello,there,_123) ?

           The "**" indicates that this is  a  spy-point.     If   this
           port  is  not  for a procedure  with  a  spy-point set, then
           there will be two spaces there instead.  If this port is the
           requested  return  from a  Skip  then  the second  character
           becomes ">".  This gives four possible combinations:


               "**"   This is a spy-point.
               "*>"

                      This  is a spy-point, and you also did a Skip last time you were in
                      this box.
               " >"

                      This is not a spy-point, but you did a Skip last time you  were  in
                      this box.
               "  "   This is not a spy-point.



           The  number  in  parentheses  is   the   unique   invocation
           identifier.  This is continuously incrementing regardless of
           whether or not you  are  actually  seeing  the   invocations
           (provided  that  debug mode is on).  This number can be used
           to cross correlate the trace messages for the various ports,
           since  it   is   unique  for  every  invocation.    It  will
           also  give  an indication of the number of  procedure  calls
           made  since  the  start  of  the  execution.  The invocation
           counter starts  again for every fresh execution  of  a  com-
           mand, and it is also reset when retries (see later) are per-
           formed.

                The number following this is the current   depth,  that
           is,  the  number  of direct ancestors this goal has.

                The next word  specifies  the  particular  port  (Call,
           Exit, BackTo or Fail).

                The  goal  is  then  printed  so that you  can  inspect
           its current instantiation state.

                The final "?" is the prompt indicating that you  should
           type   in   one  of the option  codes allowed (see next sec-
           tion).  If this particular port is unleashed then  you  will
           obviously not get this prompt since you have specified  that
           you do not wish to interact at this point.

                Notice  that  not  all  procedure  calls  are   traced;
           there   are   a  few  basic  procedures which have been made
           invisible since it is more  convenient not   to  see   them.
           These  include  all  primitive I/O evaluable predicates (for
           example get, put, read, write), all basic control structures
           (that  is,  `,',  `;',  `->')   and   all debugging  control
           evaluable  predicates  (for  instance,  debug,  spy,  leash,
           trace).  This means that you will never  see  messages  con-
           cerning  these  predicates during debugging.

           _4._6.  _O_p_t_i_o_n_s _A_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e _d_u_r_i_n_g _D_e_b_u_g_g_i_n_g

                This   section   describes   the   particular   options
           that  are available when the system prompts you after print-
           ing out a debugging message.  All the options are one letter
           mnemonics.     They   are   read  from the terminal with any
           blanks being completely ignored up to the next end of  line.
           The _c_r_e_e_p option needs only the new line.

           The  only  option  which you really have to remember is "h".
           This  provides  help  in  the  form of the following list of
           available options:


               END-OF-LINE   creep         a       abort
               c             creep         f       fail
               l             leap          b       break
               s             skip          h       help
               r             retry         r <n>   retry goal <n>
               q             quasi-skip    n       nodebug
               g             goal stack    [       read clauses from terminal
               e             exit Prolog


           The first three options are the basic control decisions:

           c, END-OF-LINE: Creep

                Causes the interpreter to single-step to the very  next
                port  and  print  a  message.     Then   if the port is
                leashed the user is prompted for  further  interaction.
                Otherwise  it  continues creeping.  If leashing is off,
                creep is the same as leap (see below)  except  that   a
                complete trace is printed on the terminal.

           l: Leap

                causes  the  interpreter  to resume running  your  pro-
                gram,  only  stopping  when  a spy-point is reached (or
                when the program terminates).   Leaping can   thus   be
                used   to   follow   the   execution  at a higher level
                than exhaustive tracing.  All you need  to  do  is   to
                set  spy points  on  an evenly  spread set of pertinent

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    31


                procedures, and then follow the  control  flow  through
                these by leaping from one to the other.

           s: Skip

                Skip is only valid for Call and  BackTo   ports.     It
                skips   over  the  entire execution  of  the procedure.
                That is, you will not see anything until control  comes
                back  to  this  procedure (at either the Exit  port  or
                the Fail   port).     Skip   is   particularly   useful
                while creeping since it guarantees that control will be
                returned  after  the   (possibly   complex)   execution
                within  the  box.    If you skip then no message at all
                will appear until control returns.  This includes calls
                to   procedures   with  spy  points  set;  they will be
                masked out during the skip.  There  are  two  ways   of
                overriding this :  there is a Quasi-skip which does not
                ignore spy points, and the "t" option after  an  inter-
                rupt   will   disable  the masking.  Normally, however,
                this masking is just what is required!

           q: Quasi-skip

                Is  like Skip except that it  does  not  mask  out  spy
                points.   If  there is a spy-point within the execution
                of the goal then  control  returns  at this  point  and
                any   action  can be performed there.  The initial skip
                still guarantees an   eventual   return   of   control,
                though,  when  the internal execution is finished.

           f: Fail

                Transfers to the Fail port of the  current  box.   This
                puts  your execution in a position where it is about to
                backtrack  out  of  the  current invocation,  that  is,
                you have manually failed the initial goal.

           r: Retry

                Transfers to the Call port of the current goal,  or  if
                given  a  numeric  argument  _n, to the Call port of the
                invocation numbered _n.  IF the invocation being retried
                has been deleted by the cut control primitive, the most
                recent active invocation before it will be retried.  If
                _n  is  out of range, the current invocation is retried.
                This option is extremely useful to go back to  an  ear-
                lier state of computation if some point of interest was
                overshot in a debugging session. Note however that side
                effects, such as database modification, are not undone.

           g: Goal Stack












.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    32


                Shows the goal that called the current one, and the one
                that  called it, and so on, that is, the stack of pend-
                ing goals. Goals are printed one  per  line,  from  the
                most  recent to the least recent.  Each goal is labeled
                by its recursion level _l, its invocation number  _i  and
                the  ordinal position _p of the clause currently used to
                solve the goal.

           a: Abort

                Causes  an  abort  of  the current execution.  All  the
                execution states built so far are destroyed and you are
                put right back at the top  level of  the   interpreter.
                (This  is  the same as the evaluable predicate abort.)

           [: Read clauses from terminal

                starts reading clauses typed by the user as if doing  a
                _c_o_n_s_u_l_t(_u_s_e_r).    An   END-OF-INPUT   returns   to  the
                debugger.

           e: Exit from Prolog

                causes an irreversible exit  from  the  Prolog  system.
                (This is the same as the evaluable predicate halt.)

           h: Help

                Displays the table of options given above.

           b: Break

                Calls  the  evaluable  predicate  break,  thus  putting
                you  at interpreter top level with the execution so far
                sitting underneath you.   When   you  end   the   break
                with   the   END-OF-INPUT   character,   you   will  be
                reprompted at the port at which  you  broke.   The  new
                execution is completely  separate  from  the  suspended
                one;  the  invocation numbers will start again  from  1
                during  the  break.   Debug mode is not switched off as
                you call the break,  but  if  you  do  switch   it  off
                then  it  will  be  re-switched  on when you finish the
                break and go back to the old execution.   However,  any
                changes to the leashing or to spy points will remain in
                effect.

           n:  Nodebug

                Turns off debug mode.  Notice that this is the  correct
                way  to  switch  debugging   off at a trace point.  You
                cannot use the "b" option because  it  always  restores
                debug mode upon return.

                It is possible, and sometimes useful,  to  reconsult  a
           file  whilst  in the middle of  a  program  execution.  How-
           ever this can lead to unexpected behaviour under the follow-
           ing  circumstances:  a  procedure has been successfully exe-
           cuted; it  is subsequently   re-defined   by  a   reconsult,
           and   is   later   re-activated   by backtracking.  When the
           backtracking occurs,  all  the  new  clauses  for  the  pro-
           cedure appear to the interpreter to be potential alternative
           solutions, even though  identical  clauses  may already have
           been  used.  Thus large amounts of (unwanted) activity takes
           place on backtracking.  The problem does not arise if you do
           the  reconsult when you are at the Call  port  of  the  pro-
           cedure  to  be re-defined.

                This section describes  all  the  evaluable  predicates
           available  in  C-Prolog.   These  predicates are provided in
           advance by the system and they cannot be  redefined  by  the
           user.   Any  attempt  to add clauses or delete clauses to an
           evaluable predicate fails with an error message, and  leaves
           the  evaluable predicate unchanged.  The C-Prolog provides a
           fairly wide range of evaluable  predicates  to  perform  the
           following tasks:

               Input/Output
                  Reading-in programs
                  Opening and closing files
                  Reading and writing Prolog terms
                  Getting and putting characters
               Arithmetic
               Affecting the flow of the execution
               Classifying and operating on Prolog terms (meta-logical facilities)
               Sets
               Term Comparison
               Manipulating the Prolog program database
               Manipulating the additional indexed database
               Debugging facilities
               Environmental facilities

           The evaluable predicates will be described according to this
           classification.  Appendix  I contains a complete list of the
           evaluable predicates.

           _5._1.  _I_n_p_u_t _a_n_d _O_u_t_p_u_t

                A total of 15 I/O streams may be open at any  one  time
           for input and output.  This includes a stream that is always
           available for input and output to the  user's  terminal.   A
           stream  to  a file _F is opened for input by the first see(_F)
           executed.   _F  then  becomes  the  current   input   stream.










.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    34


           Similarly,  a  stream  to file _H is opened for output by the
           first tell(_H) executed.  _H then becomes the  current  output
           stream.   Subsequent calls to see(_F) or to tell(_H) make _F or
           _H the current input or  output  stream,  respectively.   Any
           input or output is always to the current stream.

                When no input or output stream has been specified,  the
           standard ersatz  file  `user',  denoting  the  user's termi-
           nal, is utilised for both.  When the terminal is waiting for
           input on a new line, a prompt will be displayed as follows:


               "| ?- "   interpreter waiting for command
               "|    "   interpreter wating for command continuation line
               "| "      consult(user) wating for continuation line
               "|:"      default for waiting for other user input


           When the current input (or output)  stream  is  closed,  the
           user's  terminal  becomes  the  current  input  (or  output)
           stream.

                The only file that  can  be  simultaneously   open  for
           input and output is the ersatz file `user'.

                A file is referred to by its name, _w_r_i_t_t_e_n _a_s _a_n  _a_t_o_m,
           e.g.

               myfile
               'F123'
               data_lst
               'tom/greeks'


                All I/O errors normally cause an abort, except for  the
           effect  of  the  evaluable  predicate  nofileerrors decribed
           below.

                End of file is signalled on the user's terminal by typ-
           ing  the  END-OF-INPUT character.  Any  more  input requests
           for a file whose  end  has  been  reached  causes  an  error
           failure.

           consult(_F)

                Instructs the interpreter to read-in the program  which
                is  in file _F.  When  a directive is read it is immedi-
                ately executed.  When a clause is read it is put  after
                any  clauses  already  read by the interpreter for that
                procedure.

           reconsult(_F)

                Like consult  except   that   any   procedure   defined
                in    the reconsulted  file erases any clauses for that
                procedure already present in the  interpreter.   recon-
                sult  makes it possible to amend a program without hav-
                ing to restart from scratch and consult all  the  files
                which make  up  the  program.

           [_F_i_l_e|_F_i_l_e_s]

                This is a shorthand way of consulting or reconsulting a
                list  of files.  A file name may optionally be preceded
                by the  operator  `-'  to  indicate   that   the   file
                should    be    reconsulted    rather   than consulted.
                Thus

                    | ?- [file1,-file2,file3].

                is merely a shorthand for

                    | ?- consult(file1), reconsult(file2), consult(file3).


           _5._1._2.  _F_i_l_e _H_a_n_d_l_i_n_g

           see(_F)

                File _F becomes the current input stream.

           seeing(_F)

                _F is unified with the name of the current input file.

           seen

                Closes the current input stream.

           tell(_F)

                File _F becomes the current output stream.

           telling(_F)

                _F is unified with the name of the current output file.

           told

                Closes the current output stream.

           close(_F)

           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    36


                File _F, currently open for input or output, is closed.

           fileerrors

                Undoes the effect of nofileerrors.

           nofileerrors

                After a  call  to  this  predicate,   the   I/O   error
                conditions  "incorrect  file name ...", "can't see file
                ...", "can't tell file ..." and "end of file ..." cause
                a  call to fail instead of  the default  action,  which
                is to type an error message and then call abort.

           exists(_F)

                Succeeds if the file F exists.

           rename(_F,_N)

                If File _F is renamed to _N.  If _N  is `[]', the file  is
                deleted.   If  _F  was  a  currently  open stream, it is
                closed first.

           _5._1._3.  _I_n_p_u_t _a_n_d _O_u_t_p_u_t _o_f _T_e_r_m_s

           read(_X)

                The next term, delimited by a full stop  (i.e.   a  "."
                followed  by a carriage-return or  a  space),  is  read
                from the current input stream and unified with  _X.  The
                syntax  of the term must accord  with  current operator
                declarations.  If a call read(_X) causes the end of  the
                current  input stream to be reached, _X is unified  with
                the  atom `end_of_file'.  Further  calls  to  read  for
                the same stream will then cause an error failure.

           write(_X)

                The term _X is written  to  the  current  output  stream
                according  to operator declarations in force.

           display(_X)

                The term _X is displayed on  the  terminal  in  standard
                parenthesised prefix notation.

           writeq(_T_e_r_m)

                Similar to write(_T_e_r_m), but  the  names  of  atoms  and
                functors  are quoted where necessary to make the result
                acceptable as input to read.

           print(_T_e_r_m)

                Print _T_e_r_m onto the  current  output.   This  predicate
                provides a handle for user defined pretty printing.  If
                _T_e_r_m  is  a  variable  then  it   is   written,   using
                write(_T_e_r_m).   If  _T_e_r_m  is non-variable then a call is
                made to the user defined procedure  portray(_T_e_r_m).   If
                this  succeeds  then  it  is assumed that _T_e_r_m has been
                output.  Otherwise print is equivalent to write.

           _5._1._4.  _C_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _I_n_p_u_t/_O_u_t_p_u_t

           nl

                A new line is started on the current output stream.

           get0(_N)

                _N is the ASCII code of  the  next  character  from  the
                current   input  stream.  If  the  current input stream
                reaches its end of file, the ASCII character  code  for
                control-Z is returned and the stream closed.

           get(_N)

                _N is the ASCII code of the  next  non-blank   printable
                character  from  the  current  input stream. It has the
                same behaviour as get0 on end of file.

           skip(_N)

                Skips to just past the next  ASCII  character  code   _N
                from   the  current  input stream.  _N may be an integer
                expression.  Skipping past the end of  file  causes  an
                error.

           put(_N)

                ASCII character code _N is output to the current  output
                stream.  _N may be an integer expression.

           tab(_N)

                _N spaces are output to the current  output  stream.   _N
                may  be  an  integer expression.

           _5._2.  _A_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c

                Arithmetic is performed by  evaluable predicates  which
           take   as arguments   _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s   and  _e_v_a_l_u_a_t_e
           them.  An  arithmetic expression  is  a  term   built   from
           _e_v_a_l_u_a_b_l_e  _f_u_n_c_t_o_r_s,  numbers  and variables.  At  the  time
           of evaluation, each variable  in  an  arithmetic  expression

           must be bound to a number or to  an  arithmetic  expression.
           The result of evaluation will always be converted back to an
           integer if possible.

                Each evaluable functor stands for an arithmetic  opera-
           tion.   The  adjective  "integer"  in the descriptions below
           means that the operation only makes sense for integers,  and
           will fail for floating point numbers.

                Because arithmetic expressions are compound terms, they
           use  up  storage that is only recovered on backtracking. The
           evaluable predicate expanded_exprs can be used to avoid this
           overhead  by  preexpanding arithmetic expressions into calls
           to arithmetic evaluation  predicates.  However,  this  makes
           program read-in slower and clauses bigger.

                In  general,  an  arithmetic  operation  that  combines
           integers  and  floating point numbers will return a floating
           point number.  However, if the result  is  integral,  it  is
           converted  back  to  integer  representation,  and  the same
           applies to numbers read in by the reader. Thus, the goal

               | ?- p(2.0).

           will succeed with the clause

               p(2).

           and the result of the query

               | ?- X is 2*1.5.

           is

               X = 5


                Numbers may be integers

               -33  0  9999

           or floating point numbers

               1.333  -2.6E+7 0.555E-2


                Note that the decimal "." cannot be confused  with  the
           end  of  clause because the latter must be followed by blank
           space (space, tab or END-OF-LINE).  However, if an  operator
           "."  is declared as infix, it will only be possible to apply
           it to two numbers if they are separated by blank space  from
           the operator.

           [_X]

                (a list of just one element) evaluates to _X if _X is  an
                integer.   Since  a  quoted  string  is  just a list of
                integers, this allows a quoted character to be used  in
                place of its ASCII code; e.g. "A" behaves within arith-
                metic expressions as the integer 65.

                The arithmetic evaluable  predicates  are  as  follows,
           where  _X  and  _Y stand for arithmetic expressions, and _Z for
           some term.  Note that this means that is only evaluates  one
           of its arguments as an arithmetic expression (the right-hand
           side one), whereas all the  comparison  predicates  evaluate
           both their arguments.

           _Z is _X

                Arithmetic expression _X is evaluated and the result, is
                unified with _Z. Fails if _X is not an arithmetic expres-
                sion.

           _X =:= _Y

                The values of _X and _Y are equal.

           _X == _Y

                The values of _X and _Y are not equal.

           _X < _Y

                The value of _X is less than the value of _Y.

           _X > _Y

                The value of _X is greater than the value of _Y.

           _X =< _Y

                The value of _X is less than or equal to the value of _Y.

           _X >= _Y

                The value of _X is greater than or equal to the value of
                _Y.

           functor(_T,_F,_N)

                The principal functor of term _T has name _F and arity _N,
                where   _F  is   either  an  atom or, provided _N is 0, a
                number. Initially, either _T must be instantiated  to  a
                non-variable,  or _F and _N  must be   instantiated   to,
                respectively,  either  an  atom   and   a  non-negative
                integer  or  an  integer and 0. If these conditions are
                not satisfied, an error message is given.  In the  case
                where  _T  is  initially instantiated to a variable, the
                result of the  call  is to  instantiate  _T  to the most
                general term having the principal functor indicated.

           arg(_I,_T,_X)

                Initially, _I must be instantiated to a positive integer
                and _T  to a  compound  term.  The result of the call is
                to unify _X with the _Ith  argument  of  term   _T.   (The
                arguments   are  numbered from  1 upwards.) If the ini-
                tial conditions are not satisfied or _I is out of range,
                the call merely fails.

           _X =.. _Y

                _Y is a list whose head is the atom corresponding to the
                principal  functor  of _X and whose tail is the argument
                list of that functor in _X. E.g.

                    product(0,N,N-1) =.. [product,0,N,N-1]

                    N-1 =.. [-,N,1]

                    product =.. [product]

                If _X is instantiated to a  variable,  then  _Y  must  be
                instantiated  either  to  a  list of determinate length
                whose head is an atom, or to a list of length  1  whose
                head is a number.

           name(_X,_L)

                If _X is an atom or a number then _L is  a  list  of  the
                ASCII codes of the characters comprising the name of _X.
                E.g.











.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    45


                    name(product,[112,114,111,100,117,99,116])

                i.e.  name(product,"product")

                    name(1976,[49,57,55,54])

                    name(hello,[104,101,108,108,111])

                    name([],"[]")

                If _X is instantiated to a variable, _L must  be  instan-
                tiated to a list of ASCII character codes.  E.g.

                    | ?- name(X,[104,101,108,108,111])).

                    X = hello

                    | ?- name(X,"hello").

                    X = hello


           call(_X)

                If _X is instantiated to a term which would  be  accept-
                able  as  body of  a  clause,  the goal call(_X) is exe-
                cuted exactly as if that  term  appeared  textually  in
                place of the call(_X), except that any  cut ("!") occur-
                ring in _X will remove only those choice  points  in  _X.
                If _X is not  instantiated  as described above, an error
                message is printed and call fails.

           _X

                (where _X is a variable) Exactly the same as call(_X).

           _5._6.  _S_e_t_s

                When  there  are  many solutions to a problem, and when
           all   those   solutions  are  required   to   be   collected
           together,  this  can  be   achieved   by   repeatedly  back-
           tracking  and gradually building up a list of the solutions.
           The following evaluable predicates are provided to  automate
           this process.

           setof(_X,_P,_S)

           Read this as "_S is the set of all instances of _X  such  that
           _P   is provable,  where  that  set  is non-empty".  The term
           _P specifies a goal or goals as in call(_P). _S  is  a  set  of
           terms represented as  a list  of those terms, without dupli-
           cates, in the standard order for terms  (see  Section  5.3).
           If  there  are  no  instances of _X such  that _P is satisfied










.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    46


           then the predicate fails.

           The  variables  appearing  in the term _X should  not  appear
           anywhere else in the clause except within the term _P.  Obvi-
           ously, the set to be enumerated should be finite, and should
           be enumerable by  Prolog in  finite  time.    It  is  possi-
           ble for the provable instances to contain variables, but  in
           this  case  the  list  _S  will  only  provide  an  imperfect
           representation of what is in reality an infinite set.

           If there are uninstantiated variables in _P which do not also
           appear  in  _X,  then a  call  to  this  evaluable  predicate
           may  backtrack,  generating   alternative   values   for   _S
           corresponding  to different instantiations of the free vari-
           ables of _P.  (It  is  to  cater  for such  usage  that   the
           set  S  is  constrained  to be non-empty.)  For example, the
           call:

               | ?- setof(X, X likes Y, S).

           might produce two alternative solutions via backtracking:

               Y = beer,   S = [dick, harry, tom]
               Y = cider,  S = [bill, jan, tom ]

           The call:

               | ?- setof((Y,S), setof(X, X likes Y, S), SS).

           would then produce:

               SS = [ (beer,[dick,harry,tom]), (cider,[bill,jan,tom]) ]


           Variables occurring in _P will not be  treated  as  free   if
           they   are explicitly  bound  within  _P  by  an  existential
           quantifier.   An existential quantification is written:

               _Y^_Q

           meaning "there exists a _Y such that _Q is true", where  _Y  is
           some  Prolog variable.  For example:

               | ?- setof(X, Y^(X likes Y), S).

           would produce the single result:

               X = [bill, dick, harry, jan, tom]

           in contrast to the earlier example.

           bagof(_X,_P,_B_a_g)











.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    47


                This  is  exactly  the  same  as  setof   except   that
                the  list  (or  alternative lists) returned will not be
                ordered,  and  may  contain duplicates.   The effect of
                this  relaxation is to save considerable time and space
                in execution.

           _X^_P

                The  interpreter  recognises  this  as  meaning  "there
                exists  an  _X  such that  _P  is true", and treats it as
                equivalent  to  call(_P).   The  use  of  this  explicit
                existential quantifier outside the setof and bagof con-
                structs is superfluous.

           _5._7.  _C_o_m_p_a_r_i_s_o_n _o_f _T_e_r_m_s

                These   evaluable    predicates    are    meta-logical.
           They   treat   uninstantiated  variables  as  objects   with
           values  which  may  be  compared,  and  they  never  instan-
           tiate  those  variables.   They should _n_o_t be used when what
           you really want is arithmetic comparison  (Section  5.2)  or
           unification.

                The  predicates  make reference  to  a  standard  total
           ordering of terms, which is as follows:

           -    variables, in a standard order (roughly, oldest first -
                the order  is _n_o_t related to the names of variables);

           -    Database references, roughly in order of age;

           -    numbers, from -"infinity" to +"infinity";

           -    atoms, in alphabetical (i.e. ASCII) order;

           -    complex  terms, ordered first by  arity,  then  by  the
                name  of  principal  functor, then by the arguments (in
                left-to-right order).

                For example, here is a list of terms  in  the  standard
           order:

               [ X, -9, 1, fie, foe, fum, X = Y, fie(0,2), fie(1,1) ]

           These are the basic predicates for comparison  of  arbitrary
           terms:

           _X == _Y

                Tests if the terms currently instantiating _X and  _Y are
                literally   identical   (in  particular,  variables  in
                equivalent positions in the two terms must  be  identi-
                cal).  For example, the question










.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    48


                    | ?- X == Y.

                fails (answers "no") because  _X  and  _Y  are   distinct
                uninstantiated variables.  However, the question

                    | ?- X = Y, X == Y.

                succeeds because the first goal unifies the  two  vari-
                ables (see page 42).

           _X \== _Y

                Tests  if  the  terms  currently  instantiating  _X  and
                _Y  are not literally identical.

           _T_1 @< _T_2

                Term _T_1 is before term _T_2 in the standard order.

           _T_1 @> _T_2

                Term _T_1 is after term _T_2 in the standard order.

           _T_1 @=< _T_2

                Term _T_1 is not after term _T_2 in the standard order.

           _T_1 @>= _T_2

                Term _T_1 is not before term _T_2 in the standard order.

                Some further predicates involving comparison  of  terms
           are:

           compare(_O_p,_T_1,_T_2)

                The  result  of comparing terms _T_1 and _T_2 is _O_p,  where
                the possible values for _O_p are:

                    `='   if _T_1 is identical to _T_2,

                    `<'   if _T_1 is before _T_2 in the standard order,

                    `>'   if _T_1 is after _T_2 in the standard order.

                Thus compare(=,_T_1,_T_2) is equivalent to _T_1 == _T_2.

           sort(_L_1,_L_2)

                The elements of the list _L_1 are sorted into  the  stan-
                dard  order, and any identical (i.e. `==') elements are
                merged,  yielding  the  list _L_2.  (The time taken to do
                this  is at worst order (N log N) where N is the length

                of _L_1.)

           keysort(_L_1,_L_2)

                The  list  _L_1  must consist of items of the  form  _K_e_y-
                _V_a_l_u_e.   These items are sorted into order according to
                the value of _K_e_y, yielding  the  list  _L_2.  No  merging
                takes  place.  (The  time taken to do this  is at worst
                order (N log N) where N is the length of L1.)

           _5._8.  _M_o_d_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _o_f _t_h_e _P_r_o_g_r_a_m

                The predicates defined in this section allow  modifica-
           tion  of the program as it is actually running.  Clauses can
           be added to the program (_a_s_s_e_r_t_e_d) or removed from the  pro-
           gram  (_r_e_t_r_a_c_t_e_d).   Some  of  the predicates make use of an
           implementation-defined  identifier  or  _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e   _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
           which  uniquely  identifies  every clause in the interpreted
           program.   This  identifier  makes  it  possible  to  access
           clauses  directly, instead of requiring a search through the
           program every time.  However these facilities  are  intended
           for  more  complex  use of the database and are not required
           (and undoubtedly should be avoided) by novice users.

           assert(_C)

                The current instance of _C is interpreted  as  a  clause
                and is added to the program (with new private variables
                replacing any uninstantiated variables).  The  position
                of  the   new clause  within the procedure concerned is
                implementation-defined.  _C must be  instantiated  to  a
                non-variable.

           assert(_C_l_a_u_s_e,_R_e_f)

                Similar to assert(_C_l_a_u_s_e), but also  unifies  _R_e_f  with
                the database reference of the clause asserted.

           asserta(_C)

                Like assert(_C), except that  the  new  clause   becomes
                the  _f_i_r_s_t clause for the procedure concerned.

           asserta(_C_l_a_u_s_e,_R_e_f)

                Similar to asserta(_C_l_a_u_s_e), but also unifies  _R_e_f  with
                the database reference of the clause asserted.

           assertz(_C)

                Like assert(_C), except that the  new   clause   becomes
                the  _l_a_s_t clause for the procedure concerned.

           assertz(_C_l_a_u_s_e,_R_e_f)

                Similar to assertz(_C_l_a_u_s_e), but also unifies  _R_e_f  with
                the database reference of the clause asserted.

           clause(_P,_Q)

                _P must  be  bound  to  a  non-variable  term,  and  the
                program  is searched for a clause whose head matches _P.
                The head and body of those clauses are unified  with  _P
                and  _Q  respectively.   If one of the clauses is a unit
                clause, _Q will be unified with `true'.

           clause(_H_e_a_d,_B_o_d_y,_R_e_f)

                Similar to clause(_H_e_a_d,_B_o_d_y) but also unifies _R_e_f  with
                the  database reference of the clause concerned. If _R_e_f
                is not given at the time of  the  call,  _H_e_a_d  must  be
                instantiated  to  a non-variable term. Thus this predi-
                cate can have two different modes of use, depending  on
                whether  the  database reference of the clause is known
                or unknown.

           retract(_C)

                The first clause in  the  program  that  matches  _C  is
                erased.   _C  must  be  initially instantiated to a non-
                variable.   The  predicate  may  be  used  in  a   non-
                determinate fashion, i.e. it  will successively retract
                clauses matching the argument through backtracking.

           abolish(_N,_A) Completely remove all clauses for the procedure
           with  name  _N  (which should be an atom), and arity _A (which
           should be an integer).

           The space occupied by retracted or abolished clauses will be
           recovered when instances of the clause are no longer in use.

           See also erase (Section 5.10) which allows a  clause  to  be
           directly erased via its database reference[6].

           listing(_A)

                The argument _A may be a predicate specification of  the
                form  _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y in which case only the clauses for the
                specified predicate are listed.  If _A is just an  atom,
                then  the  interpreted procedures for all predicates of
                that name are listed as for listing/0.  Finally, it  is
                possible for _A to be a list of predicate specifications
                of either type, e.g.

                    | ?- listing([concatenate/3, reverse, go/0]).


           current_atom(_A_t_o_m)

                Generates (through backtracking)  all  currently  known
                atoms, and returns each one as _A_t_o_m.

           current_functor(_N_a_m_e,_F_u_n_c_t_o_r)

                Generates (through backtracking)  all  currently  known
                functors,  and  for  each one returns its name and most
                general term as _N_a_m_e and _F_u_n_c_t_o_r respectively. If  _N_a_m_e
                is given, only functors with that name are generated.

           current_predicate(_N_a_m_e,_F_u_n_c_t_o_r)

                Similar to current_functor, but it only generates func-
                tors corresponding to predicates for which there exists
                a procedure.

           _5._1_0.  _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_l _D_a_t_a_b_a_s_e

                This section describes predicates for  manipulating  an
           internal  indexed  database  that  is kept separate from the
           normal program database.  They are intended for more sophis-
           ticated  database  applications and are not really necessary
           for novice users.  For normal tasks you should  be  able  to
           program quite satisfactorily just using assert and retract.

           recorded(_K_e_y,_T_e_r_m,_R_e_f)

                The internal database is searched  for  terms  recorded
                under the key _K_e_y. These terms are successively unified
                with _T_e_r_m in the order they occur in the  database.  At
                the  same time, _R_e_f is unified with the database refer-
                ence of the recorded item.  The key must be given,  and
                may  be  an  atom  or complex term.  If it is a complex
                term, only the principal functor is significant.

           recorda(_K_e_y,_T_e_r_m,_R_e_f)












.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    52


                The term _T_e_r_m is recorded in the internal  database  as
                the  first item for the key _K_e_y, where _R_e_f is its data-
                base reference.  The key must be given,  and  only  its
                principal functor is significant.

           recordz(_K_e_y,_T_e_r_m,_R_e_f)

                The term _T_e_r_m is recorded in the internal  database  as
                the  last  item for the key _K_e_y, where _R_e_f is its data-
                base reference.  The key must be given,  and  only  its
                principal functor is significant.

           erase(_R_e_f)

                The recorded item _o_r clause whose database reference is
                _R_e_f is effectively erased from the internal database or
                program.  An erased item will no longer  be  accessible
                through  the  predicates  that search through the data-
                base, but will still be accessible through its database
                reference,  if this is available in the execution state
                after the call to erase. Only when all instances of the
                item's  database  reference have been forgotten through
                database erasures and/or backtracking will the item  be
                actually removed from the database.

           erased(_R)

                Suceeds if _R is a database reference to a database item
                that has been erased, otherwise fails.

           instance(_R_e_f,_T_e_r_m)

                A (most general) instance of the  recorded  term  whose
                database  reference  is  _R_e_f  is unified with _T_e_r_m. _R_e_f
                must be instantiated to a database reference. Note that
                instance  will  even pick database items that have been
                erased.

                Debug mode is switched  on.  Information  will  now  be
                retained  for  debugging  purposes  and executions will
                require more space.

           nodebug

                Debug mode is switched off. Information  is  no  longer
                retained for debugging, and spy points are removed.

           trace











.
           C-Prolog User's Manual                                    53


                Debug mode is switched on, and the  interpreter  starts
                tracing  from  the  next call to a user goal.  If trace
                was given in a command on its own, the  goal(s)  traced
                will  be  those  of  the next command.  Since this is a
                once-off decision, a call to trace is  necessary  when-
                ever  tracing  is  required  right from the start of an
                execution, otherwise tracing will only  happen  at  spy
                points.

           spy _S_p_e_c

                Spy points will be placed on all the  procedures  given
                by  _S_p_e_c.   All control flow through the ports of these
                procedures will henceforth be traced.   If  debug  mode
                was  previously off, then it will be switched on.  _S_p_e_c
                can either be a predicate  specification  of  the  form
                _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y  or  _N_a_m_e, or a list of such specifications.
                When the _N_a_m_e is given without the _A_r_i_t_y this refers to
                all predicates of that name which currently have defin-
                itions.  If there are none, then nothing will be  done.
                Spy  points  can be placed on particular undefined pro-
                cedures only by using the full form, _N_a_m_e/_A_r_i_t_y.

           nospy _S_p_e_c

                Spy points are removed from all the procedures given by
                _S_p_e_c (as for spy).

           leash(_M_o_d_e)

                Sets the leashing mode to _M_o_d_e, where _M_o_d_e can  be  one
                of the following


                    full    prompt on Call, Exit, BackTo and Fail
                    tight   prompt on Call, BackTo and Fail
                    half    prompt on Call and BackTo
                    loose   prompt on Call
                    off     never prompt
                    _N

                            _N is an integer. If the binary notation of
                            _N is 2'_c_e_b_f, the digits _c, _e, _b
                            and _f correspond to the Call, Exit BackTo and Fail respectively,
                            and are 1 (0) if the corresponding port is leashed (unleashed).


                The  initial  _l_e_a_s_h_i_n_g _m_o_d_e is `half'.

                _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y  (refer  to  Section 2.2).  _n_a_m_e may also be a
                list of names in which case all are to  be  treated  as
                operators of the  stated  _t_y_p_e  and _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y.

           break

                Causes the current  execution  to   be   suspended   at
                the  next procedure  call.   Then  the message "[ Break
                (level 1) ]" is displayed.   The  interpreter  is  then
                ready   to   accept   input  as though  it  was  at top
                level. If another call  of  break  is  encountered,  it
                moves up to level 2, and so on.  To close the break and
                resume the execution  which  was  suspended,  type  the
                END-OF-INPUT  character.   Execution will be resumed at
                the procedure call where it had been suspended.  Alter-
                natively,  the  suspended  execution can  be aborted by
                calling the evaluable predicate abort. Refer to Section
                1.9.

                system is returning from the save goal in the  original
                Prolog  session  or after the saved state in _F has been
                restored by invoking Prlog with file _F as argument.

           prompt(_O_l_d,_N_e_w)

                The sequence of  characters  (prompt)  which  indicates
                that   the   system   is  waiting  for  user  input  is
                represented as an atom, and matched to  _O_l_d;  the  atom
                bound  to  _N_e_w specifies the new prompt. In particular,
                the goal

                    prompt(X,X)

                matches the current prompt to X, without  changing  it.
                Note that this only affects the prompt issued for reads
                in the user's program; it will not change  the  propmts
                used by the system at top level etc.

           system(_S_t_r_i_n_g)

                Calls the operating system with string _S_t_r_i_n_g as  argu-
                ment. For example

                    system("ls")

                will produce a directory listing on UNIX.

           sh

                Suspends C-Prolog and enters a recursive command inter-
                preter.  On UNIX, the shell used will be that specified
                in the environment variable SHELL.

           statistics

                Shows the current allocations and amounts used for each
                of the six working areas of C-Prolog, and also the run-
                time since C-Prolog started. For example:

                    | ?- statistics.
                    atom space: 64K (15596 bytes used)
                    aux. stack: 8K (0 bytes used)
                    trail: 64K (48 bytes used)
                    heap: 256K (30664 bytes used)
                    global stack: 256K (0 bytes used)
                    local stack: 256K (300 bytes used)
                    Runtime:     1.42 sec.
